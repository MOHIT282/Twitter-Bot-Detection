Detecting and Mitigating the Impact of Twitter Bots on Online Discourse
‘Bot-Buster’ is a machine learning algorithm which is used to detect and identify Twitter bots. 
Twitter bot accounts are automated accounts that can perform various actions on Twitter, such as 
liking, retweeting, and commenting on posts. These bots are often used to spread misinformation, 
manipulate public opinion, and engage in other malicious activities. To tackle this issue, we have 
developed a Twitter bot detection system named 'Bot-Buster'.

### ‘Bot-Buster’ is a machine learning-based system that uses various features of Twitter accounts such as: 
#### 1. Profile Information
#### 2. Tweet Content 
#### 3. User behavior
to detect whether an account is a bot or not. The system will be trained on a large dataset of both 
bot and human Twitter accounts, which allows it to learn and identify patterns that distinguish bots 
from humans.
Once ‘Bot-Buster’ will identify a bot account, it can take various actions, such as blocking, 
reporting, or simply flagging the account as suspicious. This can help Twitter users and 
administrators to prevent the spread of misinformation and promote a healthy online environment.
Overall, ‘Bot-Buster’ is a promising tool that can help detect and prevent the harmful activities of 
bot accounts on Twitter. With the increasing use of social media platforms in our daily lives, it is 
essential to take steps to ensure their integrity and safety.
